## Aureate

Aureate is a python program that automates the following tasks:

1) Reads sheet music and turns it into midi files
2) Makes piano tile MP4 video with the generated midi files

### I.	Introduction
Aureate was created during ESCENDO 2025 Hackathon with the following problem statement:

"""
By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older, yet currently, only 9.6% of seniors have access to senior activity centres due to manpower shortages and limited care options.

Our product, Aureate, introduces elderly-friendly interactive keyboards designed for senior activity centres. The core value lies in offering independent music therapy to enhance sensorimotor neural connections, improving both physical and cognitive abilities.

We prioritize lean management by developing a compact keyboard tailored specifically for caregiving, enabling cost-effective transportation and storage, and making our service more affordable.
