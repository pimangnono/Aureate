## Aureate

Aureate is a Python program designed to automate the following tasks:
1. Reading sheet music and converting it into MIDI files.
2. Creating piano tile MP4 videos using the generated MIDI files.

### I.	Introduction
Aureate was developed during the ESCENDO 2025 Hackathon to address the following problem:

*By 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 or older. However, only 9.6% of seniors currently have access to senior activity centres due to limited manpower and care options.*

*Our solution, Aureate, introduces elderly-friendly interactive keyboards tailored for senior activity centres. This innovation enables independent music therapy to enhance sensorimotor neural connections, thereby improving physical and cognitive abilities.*

*Aureate emphasizes lean management by designing a compact keyboard specifically for caregiving purposes, allowing for cost-effective transportation and storage. This makes the service more affordable and accessible to a wider audience.*
